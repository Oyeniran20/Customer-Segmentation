# Customer-Segmentation
Dataset Overview
The dataset is focused on customer profiling and segmentation, often used in marketing analytics to understand customer behaviors and preferences. Below is a detailed description of the dataset features:

Features Description
Dataset Overview
This dataset contains customer information and purchasing behavior data, focusing on demographic, economic, and spending attributes. The columns used for analysis are as follows:

CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customlts.*

Gender: Categorical data representing the customer's gender.

Age: Numerical data indicating the age of the customer.

Annual Income (k$): Numerical data representing the annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.

Spending Score (1-100): Numerical data representing the customer's spending score, which may indicate purchasing behavior

Objective
The goal is to segment customers into meaningful clusters based on their demographic and spending attributes. These clusters will help identify customer personas and inform targeted marketg anr deal-seekers.

Why Use Unsupervised Learning?
Unsupervised learning is suitable for this project because the goal is to uncover hidden patterns or groupings in the data without predefined labels or outcomes. Specifically:

Lack of Labeled Data:

The dataset does not include a target or dependent variable that defines customer segments in advance.
We aim to let the data reveal inherent groupings naturally.
Clustering Objective:

The main task involves grouping customers into clusters based on similarities in demographic and spending attributes.
Techniques like K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering are ideal for such exploratory segmentation tasks.
Exploratory Insights:

The insights generated from clustering (e.g., customer personas such as "high spenders" or "budget-conscious") can guide downstream tasks like marketing or personalized recommendations.
This process helps to understand the data structure and relationships withinmentation project.
